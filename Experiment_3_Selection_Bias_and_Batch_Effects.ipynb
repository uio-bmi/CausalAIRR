    "# Experiment 3: Selection Bias and Batch Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, we combine selection bias and batch effects. The AIRR data comes from 2 hospitals: `hospital1` that recruits mostly diseased and `hospital2` that recruits mostly healthy individuals. We explore three possible scenarios here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the immune state signal is stronger than the influence of the experimental protocol used for AIRR-sequencing,\n",
    "\n",
    "2. the immune state signal is weaker than the influence of the experimental protocol,\n",
    "\n",
    "3. there is no connection between the immune state and AIRR: we will show that ML models will in this case learn only a spurious correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immune state is a binary variable and can have values `True` or `False` to indicate if an individual is diseased or healthy. AIRR is a set of sequences simulated based on the values of the immune state and the confounder for the given individual. Hospital is a binary variable (`hospital1` or `hospital2`). Each hospital has their own experimental protocol that influences the observed AIRR. The influence of the experimental protocol on AIRR is manifested via higher frequency of some k-mers in the sequenced AIRRs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps for each scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simulate training and test dataset from a causal graph to include the variables as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Train an ML model (here: logistic regression on repertoires represented by the k-mer frequencies) on the train set which has selection bias and assess its performance on the test set when there is no selection bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Software used: \n",
    "\n",
    "- DagSim for simulation of the causal graph; \n",
    "- immuneML v2.1 for implanting signal in AIRRs and for training and assessing machine learning classifiers; \n",
    "- OLGA for simulation of naive AIRRs"
