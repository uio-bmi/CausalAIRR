# CausalAIRR

This repository contains experiment for the CausalAIRR manuscript. It includes 3 experiments
showing the influence of different variables on machine learning performance:

1. Stable confounding does not influence ML performance,
2. Unstable confounding changes the ML performance,
3. Selection bias can lead to spurious correlations being learned.

Each experiment has a corresponding jupyter notebook. Used packages are listed in the requirements.txt
file. All other code is located under util/ folder.
